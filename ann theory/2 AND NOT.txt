The mcculloch_pitts function takes three parameters: inputs (a list of input values), weights (a list of corresponding weights), and threshold (a threshold value for the neuron's activation).

Inside the function, the weighted sum is calculated by multiplying each input value with its corresponding weight and summing the results.

The threshold function is then applied to the weighted sum. If the weighted sum is greater than or equal to the threshold, the function returns 1 (indicating logical TRUE). Otherwise, it returns 0 (indicating logical FALSE).

In the example, we define the inputs [1, 0] (which represent x1 and x2), weights [1, -1] (which represent w1 and w2), and the threshold value of 1.

The mcculloch_pitts function is called with the inputs, weights, and threshold values.

The output of the function is printed, representing the result of the AND NOT operation.

In this example, the AND NOT operation is implemented using the McCulloch-Pitts neuron model. The output will be 1 (logical TRUE) if the input values satisfy the condition x1 = 1 and x2 = 0, and 0 (logical FALSE) otherwise.


The AND NOT function is a logical operation that takes two binary inputs and returns 1 (TRUE) if the first input is 1 and the second input is 0. Otherwise, it returns 0 (FALSE). 

the AND NOT function is implemented using a simple if-else statement in Python. It checks the values of the two input arguments and returns the corresponding result.
