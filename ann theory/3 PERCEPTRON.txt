We define a Perceptron class to encapsulate the functionality of the Perceptron neural network.

The Perceptron class has three main methods:
1.    __init__: Initializes the Perceptron object with zero weights.
2.    predict: Takes an input and calculates the weighted sum of inputs. The activation function used is the Heaviside step function, returning 1 if the sum is greater than or equal to 0, and 0 otherwise.
3.    train: Takes the training inputs, labels, and the number of epochs. It iterates through the training data, updates the weights based on the prediction error, and adjusts the bias. 

We create a Perceptron object with an input size of 8. Since we're using the ASCII representation of binary numbers, each input represents one bit.

Training data is defined for the ASCII representation of '0' (even) and '1' (odd). More training examples can be added if desired.

Labels are defined as 0 for even and 1 for odd numbers.

We train the Perceptron using the train method, passing the training data.
