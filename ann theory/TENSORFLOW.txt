Import the necessary modules from TensorFlow.

Create a sequential model using Sequential(), which allows us to stack layers sequentially.

Define the model architecture by adding layers using the Dense layer. Specify the number of neurons and activation function for each layer. The input shape is only required for the first layer.

Compile the model using compile(). Specify the optimizer, loss function, and metrics to evaluate the model's performance during training.

Train the model using fit(). Provide the training data (X_train and y_train), batch size, number of epochs, and optional validation data (X_val and y_val).

Make sure to replace input_size with the appropriate size of your input data and num_classes with the number of classes in your classification problem. Also, prepare your data (X_train, y_train, etc.) in the appropriate format for TensorFlow.


By executing this code, TensorFlow will create a neural network based on the defined architecture, compile it with the specified optimizer and loss function, and then train the model using the provided training data. The model will be trained for the specified number of epochs, and the validation data will be used to evaluate its performance.
